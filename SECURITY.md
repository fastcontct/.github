Please use **report_url** to report security vulnerabilities.

We use **report_url**  for our intake and triage. For valid issues we will do coordination and disclosure here on
GitHub (including using a GitHub Security Advisory when necessary).

Our Security Team will process your report within a day, and respond within a week (although it will depend on the severity of your report).
